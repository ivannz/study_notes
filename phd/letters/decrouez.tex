To whom it may concern. \par\bigskip

This reference letter is provided at the request of Ivan Nazarov, who has asked me
to serve as a reference on his behalf. It is my understanding that Ivan is currently
applying currently applying for a PhD programme in ``Applied Mathematics'' at the
CDISE CREI at Sklotech. \par\medskip

During his first year at master's programme in Data Science at HSE, I was Ivan's
course project scientific supervisor. The project I advised him was concerned with
using ``crossing trees'', a tree-structured multi-resolution representation of a
path of a continuous stochastic process, as a means to studying self-similarity
properties of time series and detection of breakdowns thereof. Ivan's goal was to
conduct a large numerical experiment aimed at testing a conjecture regarding the
distributional properties of the crossing tree offspring for particular types of
self-similar processes (H-sssi processes, such as fractional Brownian motion,
Hermite processes, et c.). \par\medskip

This project required comprehension in the following fields: \textit{stochastic processes}
to understand the crossing tree construction and its properties, \textit{experiment
design} and \textit{scientific programming} to set up proper numerical experiments,
efficiently generate and analyze large volumes of synthesized data, and aggregate
the results in a manner, necessary for testing the conjecture. Ivan possessed all
the requirements, which allowed him to succeed in completing the project objectives,
for which he received the highest grade. \par\medskip

Ivan exhibited high degree of independence in his research during the project and
paid more than necessary attention to rigour in theoretical analysis of the used
apparatus. He showed great responsibility and thorough reporting of the findings.
I had no problems in communicating with Ivan both on the project and related matters,
and on general topics. \par\medskip

Ivan shows great interest in such theoretical fields as mathematical statistics,
probability theory and statistical learning theory, and applied fields as high performance
computations, computer algorithms and data mining. I am sure that he is capable of
conducting independent research, that could result in advancing any of the fields
mentioned. In my opinion Ivan is a worthy and qualified candidate for the PhD programme
at Skoltech. \par\medskip

Should you have any questions, please, do not hesitate to contact me. \par\bigskip

Sincerely, \par \medskip
