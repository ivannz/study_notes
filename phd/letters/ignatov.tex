Dear Committee Members, \par\bigskip

this reference letter is provided at the request of Ivan Nazarov, who is currently
applying for a PhD programme in ``Applied Mathematics'' at the CDISE CREI at Sklotech.
\par\medskip

In the last semester of his second year (2015-2016), Ivan was my teaching assistant.
His duties included examination of students, grading of home assignments, and giving
90 minute long presentation at a seminar to the students on a topic of my choosing
from the course programme. \par\medskip

As part of course teaching, Ivan did a great presentation on Ensemble methods in ML
-- the methods which aim at constructing powerful committees from a multitude of weak
learners. The presentation was both rich in theoretical insight and practical applications
in Python. He exhaustively covered and pointed out peculiarities of such methods as
stacking, which enables construction of layered ML predictors, bootstrap aggregation,
which builds a low-variance predictor from unbiased base learners, AdaBoost, which
assembles the ensemble via adversarial teaching of learners, and the state of the
art Gradient Boosting methods. The thoroughness of the presentation and remarkable
attention to details showed Ivan's great interest in Machine Learning, especially
in meta algorithms, and his ability to present material in a coherent and structured
manner. \par\medskip

Ivan was tremendous help in grading the student projects (18 group project in total)
and assignments (up to 50 students): he did it quickly, responsibly and extremely
thoroughly. With his help I managed to stay on schedule regarding submission of grades
to the office of teaching affairs. His diligence allowed to expose a couple of cases
of cheating in the projects, as NRU HSE is known for its high student and scientific
standards and zero-tolerance policy toward such misconduct. \par\medskip

Finally, he was a major help in the final examination: he listened to student project
presentations, interviewed them and graded their knowledge of the subject. His help
was invaluable, because this year (2015-2016) our master's programe had a much larger
influx of students than the year when Ivan was accepted. \par\medskip

Overall during his teaching assistance he showed great dedication to his duties, even
though he was busy with writing his master thesis and working hard at his day job. I
value his contribution and assistance very highly. I had no problems in communicating
with Ivan both on the teaching matters and in general. \par\medskip

I consider Ivan to be a strong candidate for the PhD programme, not only because of
his, perhaps excessive, attention to detail and theoretical underpinnings, but also
because he has great interest in both theoretical and practical Machine Learning and
Data Mining, and probability theory and computer algorithms. I am confident that he
is capable of working and a team, of supporting and quickly resolving pressing issues.
In my opinion, with Skoltech facilities Ivan a worthy candidate, who will be able to
make notable scientific contributions to his fields of interest. \par\medskip

Should you have any questions, please, do not hesitate to contact me. \par\bigskip

Sincerely, \par \medskip
