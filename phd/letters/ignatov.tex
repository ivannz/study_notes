Dear Colleagues, \par\bigskip

This reference letter is provided at the request of Ivan Nazarov, who is currently applying for a
PhD program in ``Applied Mathematics'' at the CDISE CREI at Sklotech. \par\medskip

First of all, Ivan is one of the best students of our Machine Learning classes. In the last semester
of his second year at our master program (2015-2016), Ivan helped me as a teaching assistant.
His duties included examination of students, grading of home assignments, and giving 90 minute long
presentation at a seminar to the students on a topic of my choosing from the course program.
\par\medskip

As part of course teaching, Ivan prepared a helpful presentation on Ensemble methods in Machine
Learning (ML) -- the methods which aim at constructing powerful committees from a set of weak
learners. The presentation featured both rich theoretical insights and practical applications in
Python. He exhaustively covered and pointed out peculiarities of such methods as stacking, which
enables construction of layered ML predictors, bootstrap aggregation, which builds a low-variance
predictor from unbiased base learners, AdaBoost, which assembles the ensemble via adversarial
teaching of learners, and the state of the art Gradient Boosting methods. The thoroughness of the
presentation and remarkable attention to details showed Ivan's great interest in Machine Learning,
especially in meta algorithms, and his ability to present material in a coherent and structured
manner. \par\medskip

Ivan provided me with a tremendous help in grading the student projects (18 group project in total)
and assignments (around 50 students): he did it quickly, responsibly and extremely thoroughly. His
dedication to work helped us to be in time with evaluation at the hectic end of the academic year
and to prevent student's cheating. \par\medskip

Finally, I appreciate his help in the examination: he listened to student project presentations,
interviewed them and graded their knowledge of the subject. It saved me a lot of time, because this
year (2015-2016) our master's program had a much larger influx of students than the year when Ivan
was accepted. \par\medskip

Overall during his teaching assistance he showed great dedication to his duties, even though he was
busy with writing his master thesis and working hard at his day job. I value his contribution and
assistance very highly. I had no problems in communicating with Ivan both on the teaching matters
and in general. \par\medskip

I was at the defense of Ivan's master thesis and enjoyed a lot listening his talk on Conformalized
Multidimensional Linear Modelling and Anomaly Detection. \par\medskip

I consider Ivan to be a strong candidate for the PhD program, not only because of his, perhaps
excessive, attention to detail and theoretical underpinnings, but also because he has great interest
in both theoretical and practical Machine Learning and Data Mining with a focus on probability
theory and algorithms. I am confident that he is capable of working in a team, of supporting and
quickly resolving pressing issues. In my opinion, Ivan is a worthy candidate, who with Skoltech
facilities is able to make notable scientific contributions to his fields of interest. \par\medskip

Please contact me in case of further questions. \par\bigskip

Kind regards, \par \medskip
