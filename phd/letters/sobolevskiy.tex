Dear Committee members, \par\bigskip

This reference letter is provided at the request of Ivan Nazarov, who is applying
for a Ph. D. programme in ``Applied Mathematics'' at the CDISE CREI at Sklotech.
\par\medskip

Ivan attended my course in Probabilistic Methods in Modelling, which I presented
during in Spring 2015, which covered advanced topics in probability and statistics.
The course covered in greater details such topics as ``Extreme Value Theory'' and
``statistical hypothesis testing'', and introduced concepts and main results of
``Geometric Measure Theory'' with elements of multi-fractal analysis. \par\medskip

Ivan demonstrated more than sufficient understanding and interest in probability
theory and statistics, and was active in class. During the whole semester, he was
paying attention to the presented material and typed every lecture diligently. Ivan
was among the few students, who used to come up to me even after lectures to
discuss interesting questions, which went beyond the covered material. \par\medskip

His homework assignments got excellent grades, because he was very thorough, and
sometimes presented alternative solutions to problems. In my opinion, this showed
that Ivan was inclined towards making comprehensive research to gain better and deeper
understanding of the subject matter. Overall, Ivan seemed to be a responsible and
thorough student, to whom rigour both in theory and analysis of applied methods was
very important. \par\medskip

I am sure that Ivan is capable of producing results that could bring advances in such
theoretical fields as statistical learning theory, which lies the heart of Machine Learning,
mathematical statistics or numerical algorithms. I am confident that Ivan is a qualified
candidate for the PhD programme in ``Applied Mathematics'' at Skoltech. \par\medskip

Should you have any questions, please, do not hesitate to contact me. \par\bigskip

Sincerely, \par \medskip
