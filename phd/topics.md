# Research topics

### Listed in the proposal
* General framework for PAC anomaly detection;
* Conformal confidence intervals for regression based anomaly detection;
* Anomaly detection based on conformalized kernel embeddings of distributions.

### Not included in the proposal
* SVDD with deep kernels and margin based generalization error bounds;
* Learning deep kernels for conformalized kernel embeddings of distributions
(with generalization bounds).

these topics were discussed with Mehryar during his visit to Yandex.
