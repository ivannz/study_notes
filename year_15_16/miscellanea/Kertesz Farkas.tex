Let $\dcal = (x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n\in \Xcal\times \Lcal$ where $\Xcal \subseteq \Real^d$ and
$\Lcal$ can be either
\begin{itemize}
	\item categorical (no ordering, and no scale);
	\item numeric (with scale and ordering);
	\item structural (trees, sentences et c.).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inductive learning} % (fold)
\label{sub:inductive_learning}
We would want to estimate a function mapping $\Xcal \to \Lcal$. Classification and regression
problems arise when $\Lcal$ is categorical and numeric respectively.
