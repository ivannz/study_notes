abstract={We consider the regression problem based on Gaussian processes. We assume that the prior distribution on the vector of parameters in the corresponding model of the covariance function is non-informative. Under this assumption, we prove the Bernstein-von Mises theorem that states that the posterior distribution on the parameters vector is close to the corresponding normal distribution. We show results of numerical experiments that indicate that our results apply in practically important cases.},

title={Computationally efficient algorithm for Gaussian Process regression in case of structured samples},
journal={Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics},
year={2016},
volume={56},
number={4},
pages={499--513},
abstract={Surrogate modeling is widely used in many engineering problems. Data sets often have Cartesian product structure (for instance factorial design of experiments with missing points). In such case the size of the data set can be very large. Therefore, one of the most popular algorithms for approximation--Gaussian Process regression--can be hardly applied due to its computational complexity. In this paper a computationally efficient approach for constructing Gaussian Process regression in case of data sets with Cartesian product structure is presented. Efficiency is achieved by using a special structure of the data set and operations with tensors. Proposed algorithm has low computational as well as memory complexity compared to existing algorithms. In this work we also introduce a regularization procedure allowing to take into account anisotropy of the data set and avoid degeneracy of regression model.},

title={Regression on the basis of nonstationary Gaussian processes with Bayesian regularization},
journal={Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics},
year={2016},
volume={61},
number={6},
pages={661--671},
abstract={We consider the regression problem, i.e. prediction of a real valued function. A Gaussian process prior is imposed on the function, and is combined with the training data to obtain predictions for new points. We introduce a Bayesian regularization on parameters of a covariance function of the process, which increases quality of approximation and robustness of the estimation. Also an approach to modeling nonstationary covariance function of a Gaussian process on basis of linear expansion in parametric functional dictionary is proposed. Introducing such a covariance function allows to model functions, which have non-homogeneous behaviour. Combining above features with careful optimization of covariance function parameters results in unified approach, which can be easily implemented and applied. The resulting algorithm is an out of the box solution to regression problems, with no need to tune parameters manually. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on various datasets.},

title={Model selection for anomaly detection},

volume={9875},

pages={987525-987525-6},
abstract={Anomaly detection based on one-class classification algorithms is broadly used in many applied domains like image processing (e.g. detection of whether a patient is “cancerous” or “healthy” from mammography image), network intrusion detection, etc. Performance of an anomaly detection algorithm crucially depends on a kernel, used to measure similarity in a feature space. The standard approaches (e.g. cross-validation) for kernel selection, used in two-class classification problems, can not be used directly due to the specific nature of a data (absence of a second, abnormal, class data). In this paper we generalize several kernel selection methods from binary-class case to the case of one-class classification and perform extensive comparison of these approaches using both synthetic and real-world data.},

abstract={The paper is concerned with the sequential online change-point detection problem for a dynamical system driven by a quasiperiodic stochastic process. We propose a multicomponent time series model and an effective online decomposition algorithm to approximate the components of the models. Assuming the stationarity of the obtained components, we approach the change-point detection problem on a per-component basis and propose two online change-point detection schemes corresponding to two real-world scenarios. Experimental results for decomposition and detection algorithms for synthesized and real-world datasets are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our change-point detection framework.},
