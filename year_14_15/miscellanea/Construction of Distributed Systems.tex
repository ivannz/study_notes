Knowledge-based Verification andc Construction of distributed systems
Systematic theory of distributed systems: a proposal.
Clearly generalisable and extesible.

Model checking, Synchronous languages, Timed and hybrid systems and automata.

Embedded systems: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item critical safety and security;
	\item memory-, time- and, in general, resource- constrained systems.
\end{itemize}
