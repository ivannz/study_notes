Nevertheless, the model is stated as follows : (see p.551 c.1 L 30-35 of **Barabasi, Albert (1999)**) \n",
      "> To incorporate the growing character of the network, starting with a small number ($m_0$) of vertices, at every time step we add a new vertex with $m$ ($\\leq \udbff\udc14m_0$) edges that link the new vertex to $m$ different vertices already present in the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore : (see p.551 c.1 L 40-42 of **Barabasi, Albert (1999)**)\n",
      "> After $t$ time steps, the model leads to a random network with $t\udbff\udc04 + m_0$ vertices and $mt$ edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that had the initial network $G_0$ been connected, at least minimally, it would have had at least $mt + (m_0-1)$ edges by the end of step $t$. The $m_0-1$ term comes form the fact that the minimal spanning tree is the minimal connected graph."

      "In light of this observation the previous definition of attachment probability dstribution suffers from the following drawback: isolated vertices remain almost surely isolated.\n",

      "> In model B, we start with $N$ vertices and no edges. At each time step, we randomly select a vertex and connect it with probability $\\Pi\udbff\udc0a(k_i) =\udbff\udc06 \\frac{k_i}{\udbff\udc0b\\sum_j k_j}$ to vertex $i$ in the system.\n",
