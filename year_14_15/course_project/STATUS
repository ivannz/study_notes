When a task has been completed, write a date of completion and change the minus to a plus. Report to Geoffrey when completed.

ToDo (2014-12-01) :
-	1. Read and summarize the following papers :
-		• A non-parametric test for self-similarity and stationarity in network traffic, 2005 [Jones, Shen]
-		• Estimating the Hurst index of a self-similar process via the crossing tree, 2004 [Jones, Shen]
-		• Estimation of the multifractal spectrum using the crossing tree, 2013 [Decrouez, Amblard, Jones]

ToDo (2014-12-20) :
+	1. Study the matlab code provided by Geoffrey
-	2. Enhance knowledge in SSSI processes
+	3. Study theorem 1 in Jones, Rolls (2011)
-	4. Papers to read and summarize :
-		• A characterization of, and hypothesis test for, continuous local martingales, 2011 [Jones, Rolls]
-		• Introduction to Multifractals, 1999 [Reidi]
-		• MSU 2014 -- On the uses of the crossing tree for the construction and analysis of multifractal processes, 2014 [DeCrouez et al.]

ToDo
	- Check: conjectures about the offspring distribution and its relation to the Hurst exponent. Do simulations for the HSSSI (Hermite and Weierstrass processes):
	--  Check the independence assumptions
	--	P(z=2i) is geometric with p = 2^(1-1/H)
	--	P(-+|u) = P(+-|d) = 1/sqrt(\mu), where \mu is the expectation of the geometric rv


Later:
	- Original Owen's: redo the testing in the paper the using bootstrap statistics for one signal. Build trees using shifted lattices.

	- Pool all the Zs and check whether or not their distribution equals the conjectured

ToDo for (2015-02-12):
	++++++ Finalize the code and do a final check;
	+-	P(z=2i) is geometric with p = 2^(1-1/H): definitely looks like it is geometric
	--	P(-+|u) = P(+-|d) = 1/sqrt(\mu), where \mu is the expectation of the geometric random variable
	-- Since we try to estimate the the marginal offspring distribution, don't waste too much time trying to test serial independence.

2015-04-09:
ChiSquare:
	* Aggregate the tail for the chi squared use 2, 4, 6, 8, 10+ (8+ or 12+)
	* use some exclusion procedure to decorrelate the numbers of subxings
	* using the ChiSquare compare with the thoretical (geometric)
	* run ChiSquared for 2 levels
	* Structure the findings made so far
	* choose the delta: either a max range of the increments or three times the standard deviation of the increments.
