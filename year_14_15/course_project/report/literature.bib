	Abstract = {By considering the crossings of size 2n made by a continuous self-similar process, for n = ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., we build a tree of crossings that encodes the sample path. From the crossing tree, we obtain a test for self-similarity and an estimator for the Hurst index, H. The accuracy of the estimator is established theoretically and numerically, and a comparison study with three other estimators is given, demonstrating its superior performance. The estimator and self-similarity test are applied to network packet traces, revealing some previously unobserved features.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We introduce a broad class of self-similar processes { Z ( t ) , t ≥ 0 } called generalized Hermite processes. They have stationary increments, are defined on a Wiener chaos with Hurst index H ∈ ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , and include Hermite processes as a special case. They are defined through a homogeneous kernel g , called the ``generalized Hermite kernel'', which replaces the product of power functions in the definition of Hermite processes. The generalized Hermite kernels g can also be used to generate long-range dependent stationary sequences forming a discrete chaos process { X ( n ) } . In addition, we consider a fractionally-filtered version Z β ( t ) of Z ( t ) , which allows H ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . Corresponding non-central limit theorems are established. We also give a multivariate limit theorem which mixes central and non-central limit theorems. },

 Abstract = {Geostatistical simulations often require the generation of numerous realizations of a stationary Gaussian process over a regularly meshed sample grid $\Omega$. This paper shows that for many important correlation functions in geostatistics, realizations of the associated process over $m+1$ equispaced points on a line can be produced at the cost of an initial FFT of length $2m$ with each new realization requiring an additional FFT of the same length. In particular, the paper first notes that if an $(m+1)\times(m+1) $ Toeplitz correlation matrix $R$ can be embedded in a nonnegative definite $2M\times2M$ circulant matrix $S$, exact realizations of the normal multivariate $y \sim {\cal N}(0,R)$ can be generated via FFTs of length $2M$. Theoretical results are then presented to demonstrate that for many commonly used correlation structures the minimal embedding in which $M = m$ is nonnegative definite. Extensions to simulations of stationary fields in higher dimensions are also provided and illustrated.},

abstract={In this letter, it is shown that fast and exact fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) signals can be synthesized by the circulant embedding method (CEM). CEM consists in embedding the N/spl times/N covariance matrix of the stationary fGn process in a larger 2M/spl times/2M circulant matrix such that M /spl ges/N-1. CEM is exact, since second-order statistics of the generated data are those of the Gaussian fGn. CEM is fast, since the optimal case M=N-1 can be reached. Fast and exact fBm sequences can be easily recovered from fGn ones.},

abstract = {We consider processes of the form X(t) = X~(θ(t )) where X~ is a self-similar process with stationary increments and θ is a deterministic subordinator with a periodic activity function a  = θ'&gt; 0. Such processes have been proposed as models for high-frequency financial data, such as currency exchange rates, where there are known to be daily and weekly periodic fluctuations in the volatility, captured here by the periodic activity function. We review an existing estimator for the activity function then propose three new methods for estimating it and present some experimental studies of their performance. We finish with an application to some foreign exchange and FTSE100 futures data.},
